# Prio-Engine

Prio-Engine is a Direct X 11 based engine developed for my final year university project at University of Central Lancashire. Development began in June of 2016. 

I hope to expand the engine to support more than just DirectX 12 one day, however that day will be at some point in the future.

One of the key features of Prio-Engine is the detailed logging of events in a text file. This gives Prio-Engine an edge over many other game engines which choose to avoid logging detailed error messages.
